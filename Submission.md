# Summary.

The following summary was included as per the submission form : 

-----
This contribution will demonstrate the successful adoption of a DevOps paradigm for distributed computing and support services in Africa and Arabia - the region covered by the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre. 

The services configurations developed are moving out of the traditional grid and cloud space, into the "support service" space of identity federations, document repositories and science gateways, amongst others. We believe that this represents a concrete step to reproducible site deploymnet and sustainable service development.
