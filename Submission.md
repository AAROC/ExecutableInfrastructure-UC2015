# Summary.

This contribution will demonstrate the successful adoption of a DevOps
paradigm for distributed computing and support services in Africa and
Arabia - the region covered by the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations
Centre.

The services configurations developed are moving out of the
traditional grid and cloud space, into the "support service" space of
identity federations, document repositories and science gateways,
amongst others. We believe that this represents a concrete step to
reproducible site deploymnet and sustainable service development.
